## Web Phishing Detection
Phishing is a form of fraud in which the attacker tries to learn sensitive information such as login credentials or account information by sending as a reputable entity or person in email or other communication channels.There are number of users who purchase products online and make payment through various websites.There are multiple websites who ask user to provide sensitive data such as username, password or credit card details etc. often for malicious reasons. This type of website is known as a phishing website. In order to detect and predict phishing websites, we proposed an intelligent, flexible and effective system that is based on using classification  algorithms.

### Problem Statement
Phishing sites are malicious websites that imitate legitimate websites or web pages and aim to steal userâ€™s personal credentials like user id, password, and financial information. Spotting these phishing websites is typically a challenging task because phishing is mainly a semantics-based attack, that mainly focuses on human vulnerabilities, not the network or software vulnerabilities.

### Proposed Solution
Our product serves as a browser extension and it scrapes the website URL and runs it through our ML model. If our model detects it as a phishing website, the extension notifies the user. The browser extension factor is not used in any previous works. Since this is a browser extension, the user does not have to think twice before using a website as our extension will take care of the classifying work. Since this is a very hands off approach, the user does not have to do any work and let the extension inform the user about the legitimacy of the website. This drastically reduces the amount of information stolen by phishing sites and also increases customer satisfaction as they would be reassured when using a legitimate website.
 
Since this is a browser extension which would be published in Chrome Marketplace, it can be accessed and used by everyone across the world. As it is hosted in IBM Cloud, it could be scaled up and down as per demand.
